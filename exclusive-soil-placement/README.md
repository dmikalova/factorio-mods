# Exclusive Soil Placement

Changes artificial and overgrowth soil placement to not overlap each other, making it easier to place economoically.

## Overview

Makes the placement of Jellynut and Yumako soils exclusive to each other. This makes it a lot easier to cover an area with artificial soil, and then overgrowth soil, without worrying about the expensive overgrowth removing the cheaper artificial soil.

- Artificial Jellynut/Yumako Soil can still be placed on Jellynut/Yumako wetland.
- Overgrowth Jellynut/Yumako Soil can no longer be placed on Jellynut/Yumako wetland.
- With the [Invasive Soils mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/mklv-invasive-soils), Invasive Jellynut/Yumako Soil can no longer be placed on the same areas as their Artificial or Overgrowth counterparts on Gleba.
- With the [Artificial Tree Soil mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/artificial-tree-soil), Artificial Tree Soil can be placed on waters and sand on Nauvis. The icon tint and order is also adjusted.
- With the [Water fill](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/waterfill-2), [Lava fill](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/lavafill), [Oil fill](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/oilfill), and [Ammonia fill](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ammoniafill) mods the menu sort order is adjusted.
