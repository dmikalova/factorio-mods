# Utility Station MK2

A Utility Station that combines the properties of Roboport and Substation; and optionally Radar or Lightning Collector into a single 2x2 structure. To balance the power of the combined structures the recipe is expensive, requiring ingredients from across the solar system, and to fully unlock chunk alignment requires legendary quality.

This builds on my other chunk aligned mods:

- [Radar MK2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/mklv-radar-mk2): 64x64 chunk coverage at legendary
- [Roboport MK2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/mklv-roboport-mk2): 2 chunk coverage at normal and increased charging speed at legendary
- [Substation MK2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/mklv-substation-mk2): full chunk coverage at legendary
- [Utility Station](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/mklv-utility-station): Combine Roboports and Substations into a single 4x4 structure

## Overview

Adds a Utility Station MK2 that combines the functions of a Roboport and Substation, and optionally Lightning Collector or Radar:

- Created by putting an uninteractable Substation MK2/Radar MK2/Lightning Collector under Roboport MK2 - no effect on UPS.
- 4 variants are available:
  - MK2: Roboport and Substation
  - MK2-L: Roboport, Substation, and Lightning Collector
  - MK2-R: Roboport, Substation, and Radar
  - MK2-RL: Robport, Substation, Radar, and Lightning Collector
- Assembled in a Centrifuge in Space with:
  - Utility Station
  - Roboport MK2
  - Substation MK2
  - Radar MK2 (optional)
  - Lightning Collector (optional)
  - Electric Engine Units
  - Uranium Fuel Cells
  - Calcite
  - Tungsten Carbide
  - Holmium Plates
  - Supercapacitors
  - Bioflux
  - Carbon Fiber
  - Fusion Power Cells
- Recycles into itself to prevent upcycle cheezing the ingredients.
- Due to Factorio limitations the circuit wires may not perfectly align with the Substation MK2.
