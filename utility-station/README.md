## Overview

Adds a Utility Station that combines the functions of a Roboport and Substation, and optionally Lightning Collector or Radar:

- Created by putting an uninteractable Substation under the Roboport - no effect on UPS.
- Circuit connections extended reach substations.
- Due to Factorio limtations the circuit wires may not perfectly align with the substation.
- All other properties of a Roboport and Substation are kept the same.
- Assembled in a Biochamber on Vulcanis with wood and raw fish.
